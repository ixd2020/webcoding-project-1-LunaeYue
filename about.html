        <b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b><br /><br /><br />
        (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsənt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890)
        <br /><br /><br />
        He was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous
        and influential figures in the history of Western art. In a decade, he
        created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most
        of which date from the last two years of his life. They include
        landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are
        characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
        brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not
        commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of
        mental illness, depression and poverty.

        Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was
        serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art
        dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred
        to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant
        missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude
        before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his
        parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two
        kept a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still
        lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the
        vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to
        Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard
        and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist
        sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still
        lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he
        developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in
        the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject
        matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he
        worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical
        health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with
        Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he
        severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric
        hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself
        and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came
        under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression
        continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a
        Lefaucheux revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a
        madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide and exists in
        the public imagination as a misunderstood genius, the artist "where
        discourses on madness and creativity converge".His reputation began to
        grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to
        be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained
        widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing
        decades, and he is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose
        troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist.
        Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings
        to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name,
        the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest
        collection of his paintings and drawings.

        Vincent dreamed of establishing an artists’ community at his house in
        Arles, in the South of France. He invited various artists to join him.
        Paul Gauguin was ultimately the only artist to take up Vincent’s
        offer.Vincent was delighted that Paul Gauguin agreed to travel south.<br /><br /><br />
        The two artists worked closely together for a while, but their
        discussions became increasingly heated.They had different ideas about
        art. Tensions rose high. Vincent was worried that Gauguin would leave.
        His dream of an artists’ community would then fall to pieces.After a
        furious row, Vincent got very confused. In a fit of madness, he cut off
        his ear. He ended up in hospital.

      <center>His Love Life</center>
    </h1>
    <div class="abp4">
      <p>
        Van Gogh's love life was nothing short of disastrous: He was attracted
        to women in trouble, thinking he could help them. When he fell in love
        with his recently widowed cousin, Kate, she was repulsed and fled to her
        home in Amsterdam. <br /><br /><br />Van Gogh then moved to The Hague
        and fell in love with Clasina Maria Hoornik, an alcoholic prostitute.
        She became his companion, mistress and model. When Hoornik went back to
        prostitution, van Gogh became utterly depressed. In 1882, his family
        threatened to cut off his money unless he left Hoornik and The Hague.
        Van Gogh left in mid-September of that year to travel to Drenthe, a
        somewhat desolate district in the Netherlands. <br /><br /><br />For the
        next six weeks, he lived a nomadic life, moving throughout the region
        while drawing and painting the landscape and its people.

      Actually,it can be difficult to stay positive in challenging times. But
      the future is often sunnier if you look on the bright side. This applies
      just as much to us in the 21st century as to Vincent in the 19th
      century.<br /><br />
      Vincent experienced many difficulties in his life, but he managed to keep
      his spirit up after failures.When he lost his job, he did not give up
      hope. After 10 months of silence he finds his calling and he starts to
      paint and draw.<br /><br />
      Vincent didn’t find life as an artist easy, and it appears as if he
      accepted that his work would not sell. But he was convinced that his
      desire to paint would bring results.<br /><br /><br><br>
      <b>‘The day will come, though, when people will see that they’re worth more
      than the cost of the paint and my subsistence, very meagre in fact, that
      we put into them’.</b>
