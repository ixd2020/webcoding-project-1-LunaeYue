        Van Gogh presented himself in this self-portrait as a painter,
              holding a palette and paintbrushes behind his easel.
              <br /><br />He showed that he was a modern artist by using a new
              painting style, with bright, almost unblended colours. The palette
              contains the complementary colour pairs red/green, yellow/purple
              and blue/orange.<br /><br />He laid these pairs down side by side
              to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and
              the orange-red of his beard. Self-Portrait as a Painter was the
              last work Van Gogh produced in Paris; the city had exhausted him
              both mentally and physically. He told his sister Wil how he had
              portrayed himself: ‘wrinkles in forehead and around the mouth,
              stiffly wooden, a very red beard, quite unkempt and sad’.
