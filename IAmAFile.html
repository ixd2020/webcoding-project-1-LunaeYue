      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
      roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
      2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
      College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
      consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
      the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
      majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
      randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
      going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
      anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
      generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
      making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
      of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
      structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated
      Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
      non-characteristic words etc.

      Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
      et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
      This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
      Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
      amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
