        <b>These are some of the letters that Vincent wrote in his lifetime.</b>
        <br /><br />
        Vincent van Gogh was a passionate letter writer. He had a strong need to
        share his ideas and feelings. After Vincent, his brothers and his
        sisters had all left home, they often wrote to each other and to their
        parents. Many of Vincent’s letters have survived, and even some of the
        replies. The total correspondence features 902 letters: 819 by Van Gogh
        and 83 to him. By far the most letters are to his brother Theo, his best
        friend and loyal supporter. Theo kept Vincent’s letters with great care.
        Vincent was less careful – he threw lots of letters away, or burned
        them.<br /><br />

        <b>The Hague, 29 September 1872. </b><br /><br /><br />

        My dear Theo, <br /><br />

        Thanks for your letter,I was glad to hear that you got back safely. I
        missed you the first few days, and it was strange for me not to find you
        when I came home in the afternoon. <br /><br />
        We spent some pleasant days together, and actually did go for some walks
        and see a thing or two whenever we had the chance. What terrible
        weather, you must feel anxious on your walks to Oisterwijk. Yesterday
        there were trotting races on the occasion of the exhibition, but the
        illumination and fireworks were postponed because of the bad weather, so
        it’s just as well you didn’t stay to see them. Regards from the
        Haanebeeks and the Rooses. Ever,
        <br /><br /><br />Your loving <br />Vincent

          Vincent was a Dutch artist, but he wrote about a third of his letters
          in French.<br />
          <br /><br />
          Vincent came to see France as his second home. He wanted to make a
          name for himself as an artist there. Vincent usually ended his letters
          to his brother with ‘tout à toi, Vincent’ (ever yours, Vincent). He
          signed his paintings with ‘Vincent’, because French people had
          difficulty pronouncing ‘Van Gogh’.<br /><br />
          This is a letter he wrote to his sister in French.

          Ma chère soeur, <br /><br />
          si tu me laisses t’écrire en français vraiment cela me simplifie ma
          lettre. Tu me fais bien davantage plaisir à être émotionné par la
          sculpture que par la peinture – à plus forte raison puisque Theo
          m’assure que tu vois juste pour les tableaux aussi.– Naturellement
          cela ne saurait encore être un goût fixé qui n’hésistera jamais mais
          l’intuition, l’instinct est déjà beaucoup et justement ce que tout le
          monde n’a pas toujours. Mais je suis tout de même très curieux de
          savoir l’effet que te fera le Luxembourg. Est ce vrai, ce que dans les
          moments de bonne humeur je pense, ce qui est vivant dans l’art et
          éternellement vivant c’est d’abord le peintre et puis le tableau.
          Enfin, qu’est ce que cela fait – seulement si l’on voit travailler les
          gens c’est tout de même une chose qu’on ne trouve pas sous verre dans
          les musées.<br />
          ...<br /><br />
          c’est bien beau. amuse toi bien, en pensée je t’embrasse. <br /><br />
          t. à t.<br />

        My dear Theo, <br /><br />

        It has surprised me a little not to have received even a single word
        from you. You’ll say you’ve been too busy to think about it – and I can
        very well understand that. It’s already late – but I wanted to tell you
        once more that I whole-heartedly hope that from now on the
        correspondence will again become livelier than it has been recently.
        Herewith two scratches after a couple of studies that I made, while at
        the same time I’m working on those peasants around a dish of potatoes
        again. <br /><br />
        I’ve just come home from there – and have worked on it further by
        lamplight – although this time I started it in daylight. See, this is
        what the composition has now become. I’ve painted it on a fairly large
        canvas, and as the sketch is now, I believe there’s life in it. Regards,
        with a handshake.<br /><br /><br />
        Yours truly, <br />Vincent

          Vincent added drawings to his letters.<br />
          <br /><br />
          His letters are also special because of the sketches he added to them.
          He called them ‘scratches’. They were meant to give Theo or an artist
          friend an idea of what he was working on, or of what a drawing or
          painting looked like.

          Van Gogh sometimes shared secrets<br />
          <br /><br />
          Vincent and Theo trusted each other deeply, they even wrote to each
          other about intimate matters. That was uncommon as in the 19th
          century, most people avoided writing about anything too personal.

        My dear Theo, <br /><br />

        <b>Something has happened, Theo</b>, which most of the people here know
        or suspect nothing about — nor may ever know, so keep as silent as the
        grave about it — but which is terrible. To tell you everything I’d have
        to write a book — I can’t do that. Miss Begemann has taken poison — in a
        moment of despair, when she’d spoken to her family and people spoke ill
        of her and me, and she became so upset that she did it, in my view, in a
        moment of definite mania. <br /><br />
        Theo, I had already consulted a doctor once about certain symptoms she
        had. 3 days before I’d warned her brother5 in confidence that I was
        afraid she would have a nervous breakdown, and that to my 1v:2 regret I
        had to state that I believed that the B. family had acted extremely
        imprudently by speaking to her as they did.<br />
        I’m so upset by it. Regards, do drop me a line, because I’m speaking to
        no one here.<br /><br /><br />
        Adieu, <br />Vincent

          Van Gogh sent his paintings by post.<br />
          <br /><br />
          In addition to letters, Vincent also sent drawings and paintings to
          Theo. The brothers had agreed that in exchange for providing Vincent
          with a monthly allowance, Theo would receive all of his artworks. And
          that Theo would then try to sell them. Vincent sometimes packed the
          paintings in a box, but he often just sent them rolled up.

        <b>Wasmes, April 1879 </b><br /><br /><br />

        My dear Theo, <br /><br />

        It’s time that you hear something from me again. I heard from home that
        you were in Etten for a couple of days and that you were travelling for
        the firm. I sincerely hope that your trip went well. These days you’ll
        no doubt be in the dunes and in Scheveningen now and then. Here it’s
        also attractive in the country in the spring; here and there are places
        where one could imagine oneself in the dunes, because of the hills. I
        went on a very interesting excursion not long ago; the fact is, I spent
        6 hours in a mine.

        My dear Theo, <br /><br />

        Thanks for your kind letter and for the 100-franc note it contained. Am
        very happy that Gauguin’s success as regards selling continues. If in a
        year’s time he could have made enough to carry out his plan of going and
        setting himself up in Martinique, I’d think that his fortune would be
        made. Only, to my mind he shouldn’t risk going back there before he has
        5 thousand put aside, according to him he would need 2,000. But then to
        my mind he wouldn’t leave alone but with one other or several others,
        and would found a lasting studio there.<br /><br />
        What you write about the Dutchmen interests me greatly. I hope one day
        to get to know both of them personally. How old are they? I dare to
        believe that in the final reckoning they’ll feel their coming to France
        was a good thing.
        <br /><br />Anyhow, a lot more water will flow under the bridge before
        then.<br /><br />
        Ever yours,<br />
        Vincent

        My dear brother, <br /><br />

        Today, as Mr Peyron had come back, I read your kind letters, then the
        letters from home as well, and that did me an enormous amount of good in
        giving me back a little energy, or rather the desire to climb back up
        again from the dejected state I’m in. I thank you very much for the
        etchings – you’ve chosen some of the very ones that I’ve already liked
        for a long time, the David, the Lazarus, the Samaritan, and the large
        etching of the wounded man, and you’ve added the blind man and the other
        very small etching, the last one so mysterious that I’m afraid of it and
        dare not wish to know what it is. I didn’t know it, the little
        goldsmith. But the Lazarus! Early this morning I looked at it and I
        remembered not only what Charles Blanc says of it, but indeed even that
        he doesn’t say everything about it.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is
        that the people here are too curious, idle and ignorant about painting
        for it to be possible for me to practise my profession. <br><br>
        Ever yours,<br />
        Vincent
