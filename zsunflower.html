        Van Gogh’s paintings of Sunflowers are among his most famous. He
              did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889.
              Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in
              a vase, with three shades of yellow ‘and nothing else’.
              <br /><br />In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to
              create an image with numerous variations of a single colour,
              without any loss of eloquence.<br /><br />
              The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh:
              they communicated ‘gratitude’, he wrote. He hung the first two in
              the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live
              with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by
              the sunflowers, which he thought were ‘completely Vincent’.
